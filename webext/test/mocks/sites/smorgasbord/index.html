        Smörgåsbord (Swedish: [ˈsmœrɡɔsˌbuːɖ]) is a type of Scandinavian meal,

        The <a href="/"?>Swedish</a> word smörgåsbord consists of the words smörgås (sandwich,
        usually open-faced) and bord (table). Smörgås in turn consists of the
        words smör (butter, cognate with English smear) and gås. Gås literally
        means goose, but later referred to the small pieces of butter that
        formed and floated to the surface of cream while it was churned.
